### Hi there 

This is Abdul Rehman, A softwre Tester. 
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software tester with experience in manual and automated testing for a variety of applications.
I have a passion for finding bugs and ensuring that software meets user requirements.
On this GitHub account, you'll find samples of my testing work, including test cases, bug reports, and automation scripts.
I hope you find this information helpful in getting to know my testing skills and approach. Feel free to reach out on Upwork if you have any questions!
